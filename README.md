Select work from statistics projects while attending Carleton College.
This is largely intended to show my R programming capabilities, as well as the breadth of statistical knowledge I have about a wide variety of subjects.
While I am clearly most familiar with programming in R, I am more than willing to learn other languages such as SQL, and have additional experience coding in Python and Java.

The script best representative of my abilities is Final_Project_Document_Updated.Rmd, with another notable script being Stat340 Bayesian Statistics/CollegeSportFundingBayesianAnalysis/ben_rmd.Rmd.

Most notable script from each folder (note that all work done was collaborative or my independent work):
- Data Science folder: final-project-f02/final_app/app.R
- Regression folder: Final_Appendix.Rmd
- Sampling Techniques folder: Short_Report_2.Rmd
- Spatial Statistics folder: Project_Final_Document.Rmd
- Time Series folder: Final_Appendix.Rmd
- Bayesian Statistics folder: CollegeSportFundingBayesianAnalysis/ben_rmd.Rmd

Some key scripts in Carleton Comps folder (more information is in carleton-comps/code_documentation.txt):
- carleton-comps/src/zhihan/lgcp_log_intensity_surface.Rmd; plots the intensity surfaces for different LGCP models ran
- carleton-comps/src/zhihan/lgcp_uof_optimized_6_covariates.Rmd; runs the LGCP models and saves the iterations
- carleton-comps/src/Harper/Generating Ward 9 Knots.Rmd; generates the knots used for most of the LGCP models ran
- carleton-comps/src/parker/census_block_data.Rmd; generates the block groups within Minneapolis and then within Ward 9, and overlaying block group data on the use of force dataset.
- carleton-comps/src/aya/generating_sim_integration_points.Rmd; generates the integration points used for the LGCP models.
