title: "Let's cause a merge conflict!"
output: github_document
---


## Setup

1. Everyone should clone the repo.

2. Assign the numbers 1 and 2 (and 3) to each of the team members.


## Let's cause a merge conflict!

Our goal is to see two different types of merges: first we'll see a type of merge that git can't figure out on its own how to do on its own (a **merge conflict**) and requires human intervention, then another type of where that git can figure out how to do without human intervention.

Doing this will require some tight choreography, so pay attention!

Take turns in completing the exercise, only one member at a time.
**When it's not your turn just watch, not doing anything on your own projects (this includes not even pulling changes!)** until it's your turn.

**Before starting**: everyone should have the repo cloned and know which role number(s) they are.

**Role 1:**

-   Change the team name to your actual team name.
-   Knit, commit, push.

ðŸ›‘ Make sure the previous role has finished before moving on to the next step.

**Role 2:**

-   Change the team name to some other word.
-   Knit, commit, push. You should get an error.
-   Pull. Take a look at the document with the merge conflict.
-   Clear the merge conflict by editing the document to choose the correct/preferred change.
-   Knit.
-   **Click the Stage checkbox** for all files in your Git tab. Make sure they all have check marks, not filled-in boxes.
-   Commit and push.

ðŸ›‘ Make sure the previous role has finished before moving on to the next step.

**Role 2 (or 3):**

-   Change the label of the first code chunk
-   Knit, commit, push. You should get an error.
-   Pull. No merge conflicts should occur, but you should see a message about merging.
-   Now push.

ðŸ›‘ Make sure the previous role has finished before moving on to the next step.

**Role 1:**

-   Change the label of the first code chunk to something other than previous role did.
-   Knit, commit, push. You should get an error.
-   Pull. Take a look at the document with the merge conflict. Clear the merge conflict by choosing the correct/preferred change. Commit, and push.

ðŸ›‘ Make sure the previous role has finished before moving on to the next step.

**Everyone:** Pull, and observe the changes in your document.


## Code chunk to change

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

plastic_waste <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio-education/datascience-box/master/course-materials/lab-instructions/lab-02/data/plastic-waste.csv")

plastic_waste %>% 
  mutate(coastal_pop_prop = coastal_pop / total_pop) %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap < 3) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = coastal_pop_prop, y = plastic_waste_per_cap, color = continent)) + 
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(color = "black") +
    scale_color_viridis_d() +
    labs(x = "Coastal population proportion (Coastal / total population)", 
         y = "Plastic waste per capita ", 
         color = "Continent",
         title = "Plastic waste vs. coastal population proportion",
         subtitle = "by continent") +
    theme_minimal()
```
